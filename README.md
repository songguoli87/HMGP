# HMGP

Matlab code for harmonized GPLVMs (G. Song, et al., Multimodal Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models with Harmonization, ICCV 2017)

The core code of our model is given in the HMGP/matlab/ subdirectory, where each .m file is named according to the type of the harmonization constraint (F, $l_{2,1}$, tr).

Dependencies:

(1) GPmat - Neil Lawrence's GP matlab toolbox: https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPmat

(2) Netlab v.3.3: http://www1.aston.ac.uk/ncrg/
